			This application allows you to resize another application's components.<br>
			<br>
			<img src="noteResize.gif" style="float:left" border="0">
			You can do this by either selecting a single component and checking the <i><b>Control > Resize</b></i> menu.<br>
			This will show a thick border around the window you have chosen. Floating your cursor over the border will allow you to drag the component's edges around its parent.<br>
			<br>
			
			You can also select a parent window and check the <i><b>Control > Recursive Resize</b></i> menu.<br>
			This will show a thick border around each of the child windows of the window you have chosen. Floating your cursor over the border will allow you to drag the component's eadges around its parent.<br>
			<br>
			To return a component to "Fixed" state, uncheck the <i><b>Control > Resize</b></i> or <i><b>Control  > Recursive Resize</b></i> menus<br>
